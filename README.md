# Plant Facility Location Problem Solver
This project is a small Java program that utilizes the Gurobi Optimization library to solve a Plant Facility Location Problem (PFLP). The PFLP is a classical problem in supply chain management where the goal is to determine the optimal locations for facilities (plants) and allocate customers to those facilities to minimize the overall cost, considering factors such as facility opening costs and transportation costs.

# Features
Solves the Plant Facility Location Problem using mixed-integer linear programming (MILP).
Utilizes Gurobi, a powerful optimization solver, to find the optimal solution.
Configurable parameters for:
-Facility opening costs.
-Transportation costs.
-Number of facilities and customers.
Requirements
-Java 8 or higher
-Gurobi Optimization Library (with a valid license)
-Gurobi Java API (gurobi.jar)
